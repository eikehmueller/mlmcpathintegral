# Project overview 

Repository for the implementation of **multilevel MCMC path integral methods in quantum physics**. So far, this is for one-dimensional quantum mechnanical systems. Monte Carlo methods for those systems are described in [1], and so far the following problems have been implemented:

 * Harmonic oscillator
 * Doublewell potential
 * Quantum mechanical rotor (see [2])

The multilevel MCMC methods are described in [3].

### Compilation ###

#### Prerequisites ####
The code requires the following two packages:

* The [Eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for dense linear algebra
 * The [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)

#### Building the code ####
Go to the code directory `src`. Copy the machine-specific Makefile `local_MACHINE.mk` to `local.mk` and edit if necessary, in particular set the paths to the Eigen library and the GSL. Edit compile time options (if you want to save some paths to disk) in `config.h`. `make all` will build the code, `make doc` will build the doxygen documentation in the subdirectory `doc`. 

### Running ##
To run, type
```
./driver PARAMETERFILE
```

All parameters are read from the file `PARAMETERFILE` given as a command line option, so edit this accordingly. You might want to copy the file `parameters_template.in` to `parameters.in` to make a start.

### XCode setup ###
Do the following to set up an XCode project for the source code.
1) File -> New -> Project. Choose "Cross Platform - External Build System"
2) Under "Info" Tab set the directory to the one that contains the Makefile
3) Drag src directory to project
4) File -> New -> Target.
5) Chosse "Create groups" and add to all targets
